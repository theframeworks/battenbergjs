# TODO

- Correctly use the supplied icons directory to load icons.
- Work on accepting more options in constructors.
- Some longer function signatures could use an object of options.
- Some functions accept arguments they neither use or need.
- The usage and abuse of `this` is bad.
    - Can we use bind?
    - Should we change the paradigm to a more functional style maybe? See `utils.js` for an example.
- Generify / rename the CSS.
- Would love to investigate typescript, even if just for the argument and object strucural typing definitons.
- Add a proper watch setup
- Investigate proper packaging for browser direct use, commonjs, AMD, es6 module etc. for maximum usability.
- Reinvestigate gulp/build pipeline.
